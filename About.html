            <h3>Facts about Los Angeles</h3>
            <p>The City of Los Angeles holds many distinctions. L.A. is the entertainment capital of the world, a cultural mecca boasting more than 100 museums, many of them world-class, and a paradise of idyllic weather. From tourist attractions like the Walk of Fame’s collection of stars (numbering more than 2,614 and growing by one or two a month) to career opportunities like those presented in the expanding tech industry, Los Angeles is the place to be. It is the only city in North America to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice - and by 2028 the third time. Downtown L.A. is the largest government center outside of Washington, D.C. Los Angeles has the only remaining wooden lighthouse in the state (located in San Pedro’s Fermin Park) and the largest historical theater district on the National Register of Historic Places (located Downtown on Broadway).</p>
            <p>Los Angeles is on the leading edge of several growth industries. The Los Angeles metropolitan area, with more than 23,000 art jobs, is the country's leading artistic center, surpassing the previous champion, New York. In other words, Los Angeles has both a larger concentration and absolute number of artists than New York. The L.A. five-county area is also a major tech center, with more than 700,000 people at work in health services/biomedical activities and 190,000 people in aerospace. Here are some more facts and figures about Los Angeles: the city, the county and the region.</p>
